# Roblox-Simple-GameWhitelist

1. ServerScriptService: Place the mainscript.lua file in your Roblox game's ServerScriptService.

2. Upload Whitelist Script: Upload the whitelist.php script to your website. This script will be responsible for managing the whitelist.

3. Configure Game ID: Open the mainscript.lua file and locate the variable named "game_id_1". Replace it with your actual Roblox game ID. You can find your game ID in the game's URL, for example: https://www.roblox.com/games/123456789/Your-Game-Name.

4. Upload Your Game: After completing the above steps, you can upload your game to Roblox.

5. Start Playing: With the whitelist system in place, only players whose Roblox accounts have been whitelisted on your website will be able to join your game.

Feel free to customize the system and the whitelist.php script to suit your specific needs.
